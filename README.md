#H1 Data structures, project 1
======

Implemented 5 sorting algorithms: Radixsort(base 10 and base 256), Shellsort, Mergesort, Quicksort and Countsort.
Compared them with C++ sorting algorithm (**Introsort**).
Made in python graphics which shows their complexity and how the maximum value and the vector size affects time efficiency.

#H2 Countsort (#H1 O(N+K), N - number of elements, K - range of the elements )
